## Conclusion

I2 Localization seems the best choice in my opinion because of the google sheet support making it very easy to work on translation while having all the other features available (Sub-object translation, RTL Language, good documentation...). The only feature that it is lacking is the WYSIWYG that could be very useful.  

Localization Pro seems interesting also, but doesn't have the same longevity as I2 Localization, so it probably had less time to be polished. It also doesn't have that much review on the store.
